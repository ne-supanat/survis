ABSTRACT = {Hybrid simulation is a technique for testing mechanical systems. It applies to structures with elements hard or impossible to model numerically. These elements are tested experimentally by straining them by means of actuators, while the rest of the system is simulated numerically using a finite element method (FEM). Data is interchanged between experiment and simulation. The simulation is performed in real-time in order to accurately recreate the dynamic behavior in the experiment. FEM is very computationally demanding, and for systems with a great number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), real-time simulation with small-time steps (ensuring high accuracy) may require powerful computing hardware or may even be impossible. The author proposed to swap the finite element (FE) model with an artificial neural network (ANN) to significantly lower the computational cost of the real-time algorithm. The presented examples proved that the computational cost could be reduced by at least one number of magnitude while maintaining high accuracy of the simulation; however, obtaining appropriate ANN was not trivial and might require many attempts.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions inside lithium-ion batteries generate heat and cause temperature rise. Hence, it is necessary to monitor battery time dependent heat generation. In this work, a hybrid model for simulating heat generation inside a pack of lithium batteries has been developed. An artificial neural network (ANN) has been employed to simulate electrochemical and thermal behaviors of a Panasonic NCR 18650 lithium-ion battery. In order to develop the hybrid model, the designed ANN has been inserted into ANSYS Fluent software through a C source code. A 3-D computation fluid dynamics (CFD) has been developed to simulate temperature distribution in the battery pack. Experimental data has been obtained using a NEWARE battery test system at different C-rates. The outputs of the proposed ANN consist of heat generation inside the battery as well as the electrochemical parameters. The combination of the ANN and CFD modeling, which led to a hybrid model, can be mentioned as the major contribution of this work. The results show an excellent consistency between the proposed model and test data. The simulation estimates the range of the manufacturer’s working temperatures (-20 to 60 oC), regarding the considered batteries.},

abstract = {Simulating the evolution of the gravitational N-body problem becomes extremely computationally expensive as N increases since the problem complexity scales quadratically with the number of bodies. In order to alleviate this problem, we study the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to replace expensive parts of the integration of planetary systems. Neural networks that include physical knowledge have rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years, although few attempts have been made to use them to speed up the simulation of the motion of celestial bodies. For this purpose, we study the advantages and limitations of using Hamiltonian Neural Networks to replace computationally expensive parts of the numerical simulation of planetary systems, focusing on realistic configurations found in astrophysics. We compare the results of the numerical integration of a planetary system with asteroids with those obtained by a Hamiltonian Neural Network and a conventional Deep Neural Network, with special attention to understanding the challenges of this specific problem. Due to the non-linear nature of the gravitational equations of motion, errors in the integration propagate, which may lead to divergence from the reference solution. To increase the robustness of a method that uses neural networks, we propose a hybrid integrator that evaluates the prediction of the network and replaces it with the numerical solution if considered inaccurate. Hamiltonian Neural Networks can make predictions that resemble the behavior of symplectic integrators but are challenging to train and in our case fail when the inputs differ ∼7 orders of magnitude. In contrast, Deep Neural Networks are easy to train but fail to conserve energy, leading to fast divergence from the reference solution. The hybrid integrator designed to include the neural networks increases the reliability of the method and prevents large energy errors without increasing the computing cost significantly. For the problem at hand, the use of neural networks results in faster simulations when the number of asteroids is ≳70.}

      abstract={The interpretability of machine learning, particularly for deep
neural networks, is crucial for decision making in real-world applications.
One approach is replacing the un-interpretable machine learning model
with a surrogate model, which has a simple structure for interpretation.
Another approach is understanding the target system by using a simulation modeled by human knowledge with interpretable simulation parameters. Recently, simulator calibration has been developed based on kernel
mean embedding to estimate the simulation parameters as posterior distributions. Our idea is to use a simulation model as an interpretable
surrogate model. However, the computational cost of simulator calibration is high owing to the complexity of the simulation model. Thus,
we propose a “model-bridging” framework to bridge machine learning
models with simulation models by a series of kernel mean embeddings
to address these difficulties. The proposed framework enables us to obtain predictions and interpretable simulation parameters simultaneously
without the computationally expensive calculations of the simulations.
In this study, we apply the proposed framework to essential simulations
in the manufacturing industry, such as production simulation and fluid
dynamics simulation.}

      abstract={Mechanistic simulators are an indispensable tool for epidemiology
to explore the behavior of complex, dynamic infections under varying conditions and navigate uncertain environments. Agent-based
models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular simulation paradigm
that can represent the heterogeneity of contact interactions with
granular detail and agency of individual behavior. However, conventional ABM frameworks are not differentiable and present challenges in scalability; due to which it is non-trivial to connect them
to auxiliary data sources. In this paper, we introduce GradABM:
a scalable, differentiable design for agent-based modeling that is
amenable to gradient-based learning with automatic differentiation.
GradABM can quickly simulate million-size populations in few seconds on commodity hardware, integrate with deep neural networks
and ingest heterogeneous data sources. This provides an array of
practical benefits for calibration, forecasting, and evaluating policy interventions. We demonstrate the efficacy of GradABM via
extensive experiments with real COVID-19 and influenza datasets.}

abstract = {Agent-based simulation modeling is frequently used to model and simulate the spread of transmissible diseases such as influenza, COVID-19, and HIV/AIDS in communities. Besides incorporating disease-specific parameters, these models include a set of parameters to observe the effect of different intervention combinations on the course of an epidemic, bringing the opportunity to use these models as virtual laboratories for decision-making. However, these models are primarily large-scale and complex, increasing the runtime of experimentation. As a solution, metamodeling approaches are frequently employed to represent input–output relationships of simulation models. Instead of running the time-consuming agent-based model, policymakers use the metamodel to obtain predicted outcomes in a comparatively short time. In addition to time-saving advantages, metamodels can provide insights into how disease-specific and intervention parameters affect the outcome of interest. In this regard, this study uses an influenza epidemic model, FluTE, as the experimental platform. Instead of using the original agent-based model, we fit linear regression metamodels to quantify the effect of interventions, such as vaccination, quarantine, and school closure, on the influenza attack rate. After validating the metamodel, we observe that the day on which interventions start, ascertainment delay, the daily number of vaccinations administered, isolation and quarantine compliance probabilities, and the number of school closure days stand as the significant intervention policies.}

abstract = {Simulation metamodeling has been a major research field during the last decade. The main objective has been to provide robust, fast decision support aids to enhance the overall effectiveness of decision-making processes. This paper discusses the importance of simulation metamodeling through artificial neural networks (ANNs), and provides general guidelines for the development of ANN-based simulation metamodels. Such guidelines were successfully applied in the development of two ANNs trained to estimate the manufacturing lead times (MLT) for orders simultaneously processed in a four-machine job shop. The design of intelligent systems such as ANNs may help to avoid some of the drawbacks of traditional computer simulation. Metamodels offer significant advantages regarding time consumption and simplicity to evaluate multi-criteria situations. Their operation is notoriously fast compared to the time required to operate conventional simulation packages.}

abstract={<p>Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful simulation technique which describes a complex dynamic system based on its interacting constituent entities. While the flexibility of ABM enables broad application, the complexity of real-world models demands intensive computing resources and computational time; however, a metamodel may be constructed to gain insight at less computational expense. Here, we developed a model in <italic>NetLogo</italic> to describe the growth of a microbial population consisting of <italic>Pantoea</italic>. We applied 13 parameters that defined the model and actively changed seven of the parameters to modulate the evolution of the population curve in response to these changes. We efficiently performed more than 3,000 simulations using a Python wrapper, <italic>NL4Py</italic>. Upon evaluation of the correlation between the active parameters and outputs by random forest regression, we found that the parameters which define the depth of medium and glucose concentration affect the population curves significantly. Subsequently, we constructed a metamodel, a dense neural network, to predict the simulation outputs from the active parameters and found that it achieves high prediction accuracy, reaching an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination value up to 0.92. Our approach of using a combination of ABM with random forest regression and neural network reduces the number of required ABM simulations. The simplified and refined metamodels may provide insights into the complex dynamic system before their transition to more sophisticated models that run on high-performance computing systems. The ultimate goal is to build a bridge between simulation and experiment, allowing model validation by comparing the simulated data to experimental data in microbiology.</p>},

abstract = {The paper evaluates a neural network approach to modeling the dynamics of construction processes that exhibit both discrete and stochastic behavior, providing an alternative to the more conventional method of discrete-event simulation. The incentive for developing the technique is its potential for (i) facilitating model development in situations where there is limited theory describing the dependence between component processes; and (ii) rapid execution of a simulation through parallel processing. The alternative ways in which neural networks can be used to model construction processes are reviewed and their relative merits are identified. The most promising approach, a recursive method of dynamic modeling, is examined in a series of experiments. These involve the application of the technique to two classes of earthmoving system, the first comprising a push-dozer and a fleet of scrapers, and the second a loader and fleet of haul trucks. The viability of the neural network approach is demonstrated in terms of its ability to model the discrete and stochastic behavior of these classes of construction processes. The paper concludes with an indication of some areas for further development of the technique.}
